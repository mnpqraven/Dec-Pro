; A Shape is either:
; - a GCircle
; - a GSquare
; interp. a geometrical shape representing a circle or a rectangle


(define-struct gcircle (center radius reward))
; A GCircle is a structure (make-gcircle Posn Number Number)
; interp. the geometrical representation of a circle along with
;<reward>: the score, which the player gets when he collects a circle

(define-struct gsquare (corner-ul side reward))
; A GSquare is a structure (make-gsquare Posn Number Number)
; interp. the geometrical representation of a square along with
;<reward>: the score, which the player gets when he collects a square
; where corner-ul is the upper left corner
; and side is the length of the square's side

; b)

(define-struct level (stage goal))
; A Level is a structure (make-level String Number)
; interp. a level of the game
; where stage is the name of the current level
; and goal is the score required to pass the current level

; - (cons Levels (List-of-Levels))
; - empty
;interp. the head and rest of a list of levels, or the empty list
